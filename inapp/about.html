<br/>
<div id="description">
ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that enables young children (ages 5-7) to create interactive stories and games. With ScratchJr, coding is as simple as snapping together graphical programming blocks. Children can make their own projects by creating characters in the paint editor, adding their own voices and sounds, and even inserting photos of themselves. Then, they can use the programming blocks to give instructions for those characters to come to life.<br/><br/>

ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language, used by millions of young people (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr, we redesigned the interface and programming language to make them developmentally appropriate for younger children, carefully designing features to match young children's cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.<br/><br/>

ScratchJr is the product of a collaboration between the DevTech Research Group at the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development at Tufts University, directed by Prof. Marina Umaschi Bers, the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab directed by Prof. Mitch Resnick, and the Playful Invention Company.<br/><br/>

ScratchJr is generously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF DRL-1118664), the Code-to-Learn Foundation, the LEGO Foundation, and British Telecommunications.
