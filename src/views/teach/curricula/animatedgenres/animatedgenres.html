                    <p>This curriculum introduces powerful ideas from engineering and computer science that are not usually highlighted in early childhood education. The term &ldquo;powerful
                    idea&rdquo; refers to a concept that children can learn through a curriculum that will serve them beyond the lifetime of a specific classroom technology. In this case, the
                    curriculum revolves around the ScratchJr iPad application. Powerful ideas may be applied to many disciplines and will be rewarding in students&rsquo; academic and personal
                    futures. Throughout the following curriculum, both activities and lessons will seek to illustrate these powerful ideas.</p>


                    <p>The curriculum will be divided into three modules based on three interactive genres of ScratchJr-based projects. These genres are collage, story, and game. Each of these
                    modules is comprised of two units:</p>


                    <p>1. A series of lessons that introduce ScratchJr features and programming blocks</p>


                    <p>2. An opportunity for children to create their own projects by applying concepts learned in module lessons</p>


                    <p>This curriculum requires one iPad per student. Occasionally, additional materials are required, and they are noted where necessary.</p>


                    <p><u>About ScratchJr</u>
                    </p>


                    <p>ScratchJr is a developmentally appropriate programming language for children ages five through seven. Using the ScratchJr iPad application, children can create their own
                    interactive collages, animated stories, and games. The application is the product of the DevTech Research Group at the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development at Tufts
                    University, directed by Professor Marina Bers, and the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab, directed by Professor Mitchel Resnick. Funded by the National Science
                    Foundation (NSF DRL-1118664), the ScratchJr iPad application was released in July 2014.</p>

                    </p>


                    <p>This curriculum is designed to take place over the course of six weeks. Every week, two one-hour lessons are to be taught. While this particular curriculum is described in
                    detail over the following pages, we acknowledge that teachers know their students best. Therefore, teachers should adjust activities and lessons to accommodate both the
                    classroom culture and students&rsquo; technological experience and developmental levels.</p>

                    <p><strong>Introduction (2.5 minutes):</strong> The lesson should begin with the teacher introducing him/herself to the class. The teacher should explain why s/he would like
                    to teach the students about programming. S/he should briefly ask students what they know about programming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Simon Says (10 minutes):</strong> The teacher should play Simon Says with the class. S/he should discuss how this activity is dependent on properly being able to
                    give and follow instructions. S/he should then explain how providing clear instructions is critical to computer programming.</p>

                    <p><strong>Program the Teacher (15 minutes):</strong> In this activity, students will be responsible for verbally directing their teacher to special destinations in the
                    classroom (e.g. to a bookcase or a closet). The instructions the students give to the teacher must be specific. For example, students should not simply say, &ldquo;Move
                    forward.&rdquo; They should instead say, &ldquo;Move forward ____ steps.&rdquo; When sequences of instructions do not work (perhaps because the number of steps taken were
                    incorrect), students should alter their instructions. After the activity is over, the teacher should discuss how important it is to be specific and how important order is in
                    programming.</p>

                    </p>


                    <p><strong>Classroom Rules (5 minutes):</strong> The teacher should explain to students how important it is to respect each other and the equipment used in the classroom. With
                    the students, s/he should create a list of classroom rules governing iPad use. The teacher should write these rules down on the rule board, and hang these rules in the
                    classroom every time the class is working with ScratchJr.</p>

                    </p>


                    <p><strong>Getting Started with ScratchJr (2.5 minutes):</strong> The teacher should <strong>hand out the iPads</strong> to the children, and show them how to begin a new
                    project in ScratchJr.</p>


                    <p><strong>Using ScratchJr Blocks (10 minutes):</strong> Everyone in the class should watch the teacher as s/he moves a motion block (right, left, up, down) to the scripting
                    area and presses the block to make the Scratch cat move. The children should duplicate this task. The teacher should request that students raise their hands when they are
                    finished with this task. Do this for each motion block. Do the same for the resize blocks (bigger and smaller) and visibility blocks.</p>


                    <p><strong>ScratchJr Exploration (10 minutes):</strong> The teacher should encourage students to explore the application by placing blocks in the scripting area and seeing
                    where the cat moves.</p>


                    <p><strong>Wrap Up (5 minutes):</strong> The teacher should demonstrate how to save a project. Every child should save his project. The teacher should provide students with a
                    brief explanation of what will occur during the next lesson. Collect iPads.</p>

                        <p><strong>Guess the Program (5 minutes):</strong> The teacher should act out several short programs. Students should then be given the opportunity to guess what the program
                        acted out is (e.g. step forward, step back, jump).</p>

                        <p><strong>Program the Teacher (15 minutes):</strong> Students will be responsible for directing their teacher to a specific location in the classroom. However, during this
                        lesson, students will only be able to use a specific set of possible instructions instead of simply using plain English. Examples of these specific instructions are:</p>


                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>Step forward</li>

                            <li>Step backward</li>

                            <li>Turn right</li>

                            <li>Turn left</li>

                            <li>Turn until you see something</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This activity will work the same way as it did in the prior lesson. However, this time students are encouraged to use this exact instruction set.</p>

                        <p><strong>Introduction to New ScratchJr Blocks (10 minutes):</strong> The teacher should demonstrate to children how to use the following blocks:</p>

                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>Hop</li>
                            <li>Go Home</li>

                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>Reset Size</li>

                            <li>Turn clockwise</li>

                            <li>Turn counterclockwise</li>

                        <p><strong>Sequencing in ScratchJr (10 minutes):</strong> The teacher should begin a new project in ScratchJr. S/he should place the Scratch cat and the treasure chest
                        characters on the same line on the screen (on a horizontal or vertical line). S/he should then ask students which blocks need to be placed next to each other in order for the
                        cat to successfully move toward the treasure chest. Three different scenarios should be set up (e.g. cat in the upper left corner and treasure chest in lower left corner; cat
                        in the lower left corner and the treasure chest in the bottom right corner) for the students to solve together as a class.</p>

                        application. Encourage them to experiment with recently learned blocks, as well as with blocks that have not yet been taught. Have them practice putting different programming
                        blocks next to each other to make the cat move in different directions.</p>

                        instruction at their station. They stop when the teacher raises the red stop sign card. Students should then rotate to a different station. Repeat this activity until all
                        students have moved through each station once. The teacher should explain how the green flag signifies the start of a program, while the red stop sign signifies the end of a
                        program.</p>

                        to arrive at two different locations. Introduce the idea of the green flag and red blocks. Then have both teachers follow their program when the green flag card is held up,

                        <p><strong>Programming with ScratchJr (15 minutes):</strong> The teacher should <strong>hand out the iPads</strong> and then write a program for students to copy onto their
                        own iPads. Begin with a simple warm up program that does not introduce new blocks. Then create a program for children to copy that uses the start on green flag and end blocks.
                        Lastly, create a program for children to copy that involves programming two different characters. Now encourage students to write their own programs for two different
                        characters.</p>

                        <p><strong>Design the Program (10 minutes):</strong> During this activity, the teacher should ask students to help him/her program two different characters on his/her iPad.
                        S/he should provide the students with one scenario for each character (e.g. have one character move up five spaces and then jump three times, while the other character jumps
                        five times and then disappears). The teacher should then ask students to tell him/her which blocks to place down for each character. <em>Remember to use the green flag and red

                        ipads.</strong> The teacher should then ask the students to figure out which programming blocks s/he used to create those two programs by duplicating the sequence on their own

                        <p>In this lesson, children will be introduced to the concept of speed in the ScratchJr iPad application. Through interactive activities, students will acquire an
                        understanding of this concept and how to apply it in ScratchJr. During the lesson, students will be able to create their own projects using concepts learned in this and prior
                        lessons. The lesson will conclude with an opportunity for students to share their projects.</p>

                        jump up and down. Which block would make the cat do this?&rdquo; The children should then describe the block and how to find it in the program. This should be repeated for all

                        <p><strong>Jungle Speed (10 minutes):</strong> During this activity, students will work as a class to order groups of animals or insects based on how fast they move (from
                        fastest to slowest). Write groups of animals on the board for students to verbally put in order of speed of movement. Examples of groups of animals may include:</p>


                        <p>1. Cheetah, snail, rabbit, hamster</p>


                        <p>2. Dog, ant, lion, guinea pig</p>

                        <p>A discussion should follow that discusses how characters in ScratchJr can be made to move at different speeds. The teacher should introduce the speed programming block and
                        demonstrate how to use it on the ScratchJr application.</p>

                        <p><strong>Can I Make Characters Race (15 minutes)?</strong> The teacher should project his/her iPad onto the board and explain that the class will be making three ScratchJr
                        characters race. S/he should ask students to help him/her add and delete characters and choose a background. As a class, students should decide at which speed characters will
                        move in this race, and where on the screen/background the characters should move. The class should suggest different blocks to use to make each character move. <em>Remember to
                        highlight how the green flag is essential when programming more than one character!</em> When each character is programmed, show the class the race they created!</p>

                        <p><strong>Project Sharing (8 minutes):</strong>Have students share their races with the class by projecting them onto the board. Ask students to explain their races and which

                        <p><strong>Why numbers? (10 minutes):</strong> The teacher should ask for a student volunteer. Once a volunteer is chosen, the teacher should instruct the student privately to
                        listen to the directions s/he gives, and jump the wrong number of times. For example, s/he should say to the student, &ldquo;I want you to jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
                        jump.&rdquo; The student should then jump the wrong number of times. The teacher should repeat the directions, and the student should again jump the wrong number of times.
                        After doing this, the teacher should ask the class how this instruction could be clearer (e.g. by saying, &ldquo;I want you to jump seven times). The teacher should then
                        explain the concept of putting a number under a programming block, instead of putting that same block down multiple times. S/he should show how to do this on the iPad.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why repeat? (8 minutes):</strong> The teacher should ask for a student volunteer. S/he should say to the student, &ldquo;I want you to jump, tap your head, and clap
                        your hands.&rdquo; The teacher should say this instruction to the student multiple times, and the student should continue to follow these directions. The teacher should then
                        ask the class how this instruction could be clearer. The teacher should then explain the concept of the repeat and repeat forever blocks, and show students how to use them on
                        the ScratchJr application.</p>

                        </p>


                        <p>1. The teacher should <strong>hand out the iPads</strong> and then build a program(s) on his/her iPad that includes putting numbers under motion blocks and repeat blocks.
                        Students must then follow along and build the program(s) the teacher made <strong>(10 minutes)</strong>.</p>


                        <p>2. The students should then build their own program where they place numbers under the blocks <strong>(5 minutes)</strong>.</p>


                        <p>3. The students should then build their own program where they use the repeat or repeat forever blocks <strong>(10 minutes)</strong>.</p>


                        <p>4. Have the students place the Scratch cat and a second character at approximately the same height on the screen. The students should then build two different programs with
                        the minimum number of blocks for the Scratch cat to move over to the other character: one program will use a number under the move block, and the other program will use the
                        repeat block. Make sure students understand that they should not use more than one move block in this exercise.</p>

                        <p><strong>&ldquo;Scratch-lib&rdquo; (25 minutes):</strong> During this activity, the teacher should project his/her iPad onto the board. S/he should create a simple sequence
                        with motion blocks and a speech bubble and a sound. The teacher should then demonstrate how to use these two new blocks. <strong>Hand out the ipads.</strong> The class will
                        copy this sequence onto their own iPads. They then have the liberty to insert their own text or sounds into the blocks.</p>


                        <p>After the students have completed this task, the teacher should continue by teaching students how to add a page to a project. S/he should also make sure that students
                        understand that to continue a story, an &ldquo;end block&rdquo; with a picture of the next page must be inserted at the end of</p>

                        </p>


                        <p><strong>Sharing (10 minutes):</strong> After students have finished their &ldquo;Scratch-libs&rdquo; they should be given the opportunity to share their projects with the
                        rest of the class. Students should try to explain what they created and which blocks they used.</p>

                        <p><strong>Wait! (5 minutes):</strong> The teacher should introduce the students to the &ldquo;wait for&rdquo; block. The &ldquo;wait for&rdquo; block pauses a program for a
                        certain amount of time determined by the number entered on the block. The &ldquo;wait for&rdquo; block can be used, for example, to slow down the program before going to the
                        next page of a story so that there is a pause in the action between one scene and the next.</p>

                        story. They will then spend the remainder of the lesson designing their own stories. On the second Story Project Day, students will spend the entire lesson creating and
                        sharing their stories with the class.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The teacher should read a short story to his/her students. S/he should try to choose a story that has characters that are in the character library of the ScratchJr
                        application. S/he should ask students what characters are in the story and where the story takes place. S/he should also explain that a story has a beginning, middle, and end.
                        When creating their stories, the kindergartners should use the characters they read about in the story.</p>

                        <p>The teacher should review some of the recently learned programming blocks with students. S/he should project the iPad onto the board, and show students the various
                        programming blocks. S/he should ask them to verbally describe what each block can be used for.</p>

                        <strong>Scavenger Hunt (7 minutes):</strong> With the class, the teacher should list ten objects that can be found in the room (e.g. red marker, backpack, eraser). S/he should
                        explain to the class that one child is to retrieve the first object on the list from its location in the room. Once the student has obtained the object, s/he is to high-five
                        another student in the class, who will then go and retrieve the next object on the list. Continue this process until all of the objects on the list have been retrieved. The
                        teacher should then explain how this activity relates to the start on bump and start on tap block.</p>

                        <p><strong>iPad Demonstration (15 minutes):</strong> The teacher should demonstrate how to use the start on bump and start on tap blocks. In these demonstrations, s/he should
                        use characters that complement each other, so that it is clear who is receiving the &ldquo;bump&rdquo; or &ldquo;tap.&rdquo; Such pairs may include:</p>


                        <p>1. Magician and dragon</p>


                        <p>2. Frog and fly</p>


                        <p>3. Sun and moon</p>


                        <p>After the teacher has demonstrated how to use these two blocks, s/he should <strong>hand out the iPads</strong>. The students should be given the opportunity to practice
                        these blocks using two characters that the teacher chooses.</p>


                        <p><strong>&ldquo;Three, two, one, blast off&rdquo;</strong> <strong>(15 minutes):</strong> During this activity, the teacher should project the Scratch cat and the rocket
                        onto the board. S/he should show the cat counting down &ldquo;Three, two, one&rdquo; and then have the space ship &ldquo;take off&rdquo; by moving upward. After this
                        demonstration has occurred, the teacher should show the children the programming blocks that made this occur. S/he should show students how to use the send and receive message
                        blocks, and how the message colors must match each other in order for the message to occur. Students should then be given the opportunity to recreate this demonstration
                        themselves on their own iPads.</p>

                        <p><strong>Stop! (5 minutes):</strong> The teacher should demonstrate how to use the stop block in ScratchJr. The stop block is used to terminate all programs running for a
                        particular character. To teach this block, s/he should have two characters. The first character has two programs: one that repeats forever and a second one that stops when
                        it&rsquo;s bumped. The second character should have a sequence that repeats forever. For example:</p>

                        <p>Place the penguin to the right of the cat. The cat will stop moving as soon as it bumps into the penguin, but the penguin will keep jumping forever.</p>

                        <strong>iPad Exploration (13 minutes):</strong> Allow children to continue working on their projects. They should be using the blocks learned in this lesson. They should have

                        <p>The teacher should explain to students that during this lesson, they will design their own games. With the class, the teacher should brainstorm elements of a game (e.g.
                        rules, obstacles, a goal). S/he should write down their ideas on the board.</p>


                        <p>
                        </p>


                        <p><strong>Example Games (10 minutes):</strong>
                        </p>


                        <p>The teacher should demonstrate two types of games to students that can be made with ScratchJr. <em>(Note: there are more than two types of games that can be made with
                        ScratchJr.)</em></p>


                        <p>1. <strong>&ldquo;Make the Cat Come Back&rdquo; &ndash;</strong> The teacher should use the &ldquo;tap to start&rdquo; block to make several characters into buttons. S/he
                        should then program <em>one</em> character to send a message to a hidden cat so that it reappears. Students should then tap the various characters until the cat reappears.</p>


                        <p>2. <strong>&ldquo;Get the Cat to the Birthday Cake&rdquo;</strong> &ndash; The teacher should use the &ldquo;tap to start&rdquo; block to make a character into a button.
                        S/he should program the character to send a message to the cat so that the cat will move in the direction of a birthday cake. Have students continue tapping the character
                        until the cat arrives at the cake.</p>

                        <p>Students should spend about 35 minutes designing and creating their own games. <strong>Hand out the iPads individually</strong> when design is adequate. Examples of games
                        could include:</p>


                        <p>1. Creating a maze</p>


                        <p>2. Having a character collect objects (that disappear when bumped into) on the way to another character</p>


                        <p>3. Having characters become buttons that send messages to other characters to carry out a sequence</p>


                        <p>
                        </p>


                        <p><strong>Sharing (10 minutes):</strong>
