                    ScratchJr Family Day is a community event where parents, grandparents, siblings,
                    extended family members, and children can work together to create projects
                    in ScratchJr!
                    The goal of Family Day is not only to help adults and children feel more
                    comfortable using ScratchJr, but also to encourage collaboration between
                    adults and children while
                    creating ScratchJr projects.

                    This event is for anyone who wants to create a ScratchJr community!
                    It can be done through schools, museum, after-school programs,
                    community centers, or anywhere else where
                    families can come together. Children between the ages of 5-7 as well
                    as their family members (including siblings or family members who
                    are older or younger) are encouraged to participate!
